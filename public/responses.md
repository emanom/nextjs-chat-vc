## **1. Task Ranking**

Based on my experience and preferences, here are my explanations for why specific tasks are my most favourite or least favourite:


#### Most favourite tasks**

**1. Identify, file (and, where possible, resolve) bugs in private and public Vercel/Next.js repos on GitHub:**

I would enjoy this task because it involves deep technical problem-solving and helps improve the overall product. My experience with web architecture and frontend frameworks like Next.js makes me well-suited for identifying and resolving bugs.

**2. Write and maintain support articles and docs pages:**

Writing support articles is rewarding because it allows me to share my knowledge and help users help themselves. My ability to communicate complex technical concepts is a key strength.

**3. Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case:**

Creating video tutorials combines my technical expertise with my ability to explain things clearly. Creating resources that can guide users step-by-step through using Vercel’s features is satisfying.

**4. Analyse hundreds of support tickets to spot trends the product team can use:**

Analysing support tickets to identify trends allows me to use my analytical skills to provide valuable insights to the product team. This proactive approach helps improve the product and enhance customer satisfaction.

**5. Work with the product team to develop a new feature based on feedback from customers:**

Collaborating with the product team to create new features based on customer feedback is exciting because it directly influences the product roadmap. My experience in customer success roles has given me a good understanding of customer needs and how to translate them into actionable features.


#### **Least favourite tasks**

**1. Manage a support team:**

Managing a support team involves a lot of administrative and HR-related tasks, which are less appealing to me compared to hands-on technical work. While leadership is essential, I prefer directly focusing on solving technical challenges and improving support processes to start with.

**2. Help resolve billing issues for customers:**

Although important, billing issues could be more engaging for me than technical problem-solving. I prefer tasks that leverage my technical expertise over those focused on financial matters.

**3. Find and recruit teammates for the support team:**

Recruitment tasks fall outside my primary focus on technical support and customer success. I would rather concentrate on solving technical issues and improving support processes than on HR-related activities.

**4. Respond to queries on Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News, and other 3rd party sites:**

Engaging on social media for support is not my preferred method. I find more value in direct, technical interactions through formal channels like email or support tickets.

**5. Engage multiple users at once in a public discussion to answer their questions and troubleshoot problems:**

Like social media interactions, public discussion forums are not where I shine. I prefer structured, one-on-one support where I can deliver detailed and personalised assistance, making the support experience more effective and satisfying for the customer.

## **3. Solving a technical issue in a previous support role**

As a Senior Customer Engineer at Nuance Communications, I encountered a significant technical challenge that required a methodical and innovative approach to resolving.

One of our major clients, a large financial institution, was experiencing intermittent outages with their biometric security product, which was critical for customer authentication. These outages caused inconvenience to the client and posed a potential security risk.


#### **Steps taken to resolve the issue:**

1. Issue Identification:

I began by gathering detailed logs and usage data from the client. This involved working closely with their IT team to ensure all relevant information was collected.

2. Recreating the Problem:

To better understand the issue, I replicated the issue in a test environment that mimicked the client’s setup. This allowed me to recreate the problem and observe it under controlled conditions.

3. Root Cause Analysis:

Through extensive log analysis and performance monitoring, I identified the issue as related to resource contention. During peak usage times, the biometric security product consumed more resources than anticipated, leading to outages.

4. Implementing a Solution:

I provided my findings to the development team, who worked on a successfully tested solution in the development environment.

5. Testing and Deployment:

After implementing the optimizations, the QA team conducted rigorous testing in the test environment to ensure the issue was resolved. This included stress testing to confirm that the solution could handle peak loads without causing outages.

Once confident in the solution, we coordinated with the client to deploy the changes to their live environment during a scheduled maintenance window to minimise impact.


#### **Determining success:**

1. Monitoring and Feedback:

Post-deployment, I set up monitoring to track the performance of the biometric security product in real-time. This allowed for the immediate detection of any anomalies.

I maintained close communication with the client to gather their feedback and ensure they were satisfied with the resolution.

2. Performance Metrics:

The success of the solution was evident through several key performance metrics:



* The frequency of outages dropped to zero, indicating the system’s stability.
* Resource utilisation was optimised, with no instances of overconsumption during peak times.
* The client reported a smoother user experience and no further interruptions in their authentication process.

3. Client Satisfaction:

The ultimate measure of success was the client’s satisfaction. They appreciated the quick and effective resolution, reinforcing their trust in our support and technical capabilities.

This experience resolved a critical issue for the client and enhanced my problem-solving and resource optimization skills in serverless environments. It demonstrated the importance of thorough analysis, careful implementation, and continuous monitoring to ensure long-term success.

## **4. When to use Edge Functions, Serverless Functions, or Edge Middleware with Vercel?**


### **Edge functions**

**Use case:** When you need to deliver dynamic content quickly and globally.

Edge Functions are ideal for tasks like data fetching or rewrites because they operate after the cache​.

**Benefits:**



* Executes in the region nearest to your users or data sources.
* Offers cost savings by using fewer resources than Serverless Functions.
* Access to geolocation and IP address of visitors for location-based personalization.
* Example: Personalising content based on user location.


### **Serverless functions**

**Use case: **When you need scalable backend functions that adjust resource consumption based on traffic demands. Serverless Functions are useful for scenarios where you need a flexible runtime environment that can handle various backend processes efficiently.

**Benefits:**



* Prevents failures during peak hours.
* Reduces costs during low activity periods.
* Example: Handling API requests that require backend processing.


### **Edge middleware**

**Use case**: When you need to modify requests before they reach your site or before the cache is hit. Edge Middleware is highly effective for A/B testing, geolocation, and security enhancements like bot protection and quick, secure sign-ons. It allows for modifications at the edge, reducing the need for client-side scripts and improving overall performance

**Benefits:**



* Executes before a request is processed, allowing for request modifications.
* Effective for personalising statically generated content.
* Example: Adding authentication or A/B testing logic before serving the content.

## **7. Redirecting from /blog to [example.com](http://example.com/)**

Hi there,

Thank you for reaching out to Support.

To set up a redirect from the /blog path to [https://example.com](https://example.com/), you can use Vercel’s redirect configuration in your vercel.json file. Here’s how you can do it:

1. Create or update vercel.json: If you don’t already have a vercel.json file in your project, create one in the root directory of your project. If you already have one, open it for editing.

2. Add redirect configuration: Add the following redirect rule to the redirects array in your vercel.json file:


```
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/blog",
      "destination": "https://example.com",
      "permanent": true
    }
  ]
}
```

This configuration tells Vercel to permanently redirect any requests to /blog to [https://example.com](https://example.com/).

Deploy your changes: Once you’ve added the redirect rule, deploy your project to Vercel. The redirect will take effect immediately after deployment.

## **8. Preventing a project from being indexed by search engines**

Hi there,

Thank you for reaching out to Support.

If you want your project not to be indexed by search engines, you can achieve this by setting the X-Robots-Tag HTTP header to noindex. This will instruct search engines not to index your site.

Here’s how you can do it:

1. Using vercel.json: You can add custom headers in your vercel.json file to set the X-Robots-Tag header. Here’s an example configuration: 


```
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "X-Robots-Tag",
          "value": "noindex"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```


This configuration will apply the X-Robots-Tag: noindex header to all routes in your project.

2. Deploy your changes: Once you’ve added the header configuration, deploy your project to Vercel. The noindex directive will take effect immediately after deployment.

By setting this header, search engines will be instructed not to index any pages of your site, ensuring that your content remains private.

If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask. We’re here to help!

Best regards,

Vercel Support Team

## **10. Improving the exercise**

1. Incorporate more real-world scenarios

Current issue: While the current questions are good, adding more real-world scenarios can better gauge a candidate’s practical knowledge.Improvement: Include questions that mimic real-world support scenarios more closely, such as dealing with a frustrated customer or optimising performance.

Example: “A customer reports that their website is loading slowly. Describe the steps you would take to diagnose and resolve this issue. What tools and metrics would you use?”

2. Enhanced customer interaction questions

Current issue: The current customer interaction questions are excellent but could be enhanced to further test empathy and communication skills.Improvement: Add scenarios that require empathetic communication and conflict resolution skills.

Example: “A customer writes in stating they are dissatisfied with Vercel’s service and are considering moving to another platform. Craft a response that addresses their concerns, highlights Vercel’s strengths, and encourages them to stay.”

3. Improving instructions for answer submission

The instruction to add responses directly into the Vercel project can be vague and lead to confusion about where and how to format the answers.

Current instruction:

“Please complete the following questions by adding the response directly into your Vercel project. Do not create a separate document.”

Improved instruction:

“Please complete the following questions by creating a file named [exercise-responses.md](http://exercise-responses.md/) at the root of your Vercel project repository. Add your responses to this markdown file, ensuring each answer is clearly labelled with the corresponding question number and title. Do not submit separate documents or external files.”
