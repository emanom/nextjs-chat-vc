### **Brief Explanation for Each Task Ranking**

Based on my experience and preferences, here are my explanations for why specific tasks are my most favourite or least favourite:


#### Most favourite tasks  



1. **Identify, file (and, where possible, resolve) bugs in private and public Vercel/Next.js repos on GitHub:**
    * I would enjoy this task because it involves deep technical problem-solving and helps improve the overall product. My experience with web architecture and frontend frameworks like Next.js makes me well-suited for identifying and resolving bugs. \

2. **Write and maintain support articles and docs pages:**
    * Writing support articles is rewarding because it allows me to share my knowledge and help users help themselves. My ability to communicate complex technical concepts is a key strength. \

3. **Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case:**
    * Creating video tutorials combines my technical expertise with my ability to explain things clearly. Creating resources that can guide users step-by-step through using Vercelâ€™s features is satisfying. \

4. **Analyse hundreds of support tickets to spot trends the product team can use:**
    * Analysing support tickets to identify trends allows me to use my analytical skills to provide valuable insights to the product team. This proactive approach helps improve the product and enhance customer satisfaction. \

5. **Work with the product team to develop a new feature based on feedback from customers:**
    * Collaborating with the product team to create new features based on customer feedback is exciting because it directly influences the product roadmap. My experience in customer success roles has given me a good understanding of customer needs and how to translate them into actionable features. \


#### Least favourite tasks  


1. **Manage a support team:**
    * Managing a support team involves a lot of administrative and HR-related tasks, which are less appealing to me compared to hands-on technical work. While leadership is essential, I prefer directly focusing on solving technical challenges and improving support processes to start with. \

2. **Help resolve billing issues for customers:**
    * Although important, billing issues could be more engaging for me than technical problem-solving. I prefer tasks that leverage my technical expertise over those focused on financial matters. \

3. **Find and recruit teammates for the support team:**
    * Recruitment tasks fall outside my primary focus on technical support and customer success. I would rather concentrate on solving technical issues and improving support processes than on HR-related activities. \

4. **Respond to queries on Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News, and other 3rd party sites:**
    * Engaging on social media for support is not my preferred method. I find more value in direct, technical interactions through formal channels like email or support tickets. \

5. **Engage multiple users at once in a public discussion to answer their questions and troubleshoot problems:**
    * Like social media interactions, public discussion forums are not where I shine. I prefer structured, one-on-one support where I can deliver detailed and personalised assistance, making the support experience more effective and satisfying for the customer.
